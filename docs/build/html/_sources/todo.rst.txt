To do
=====

This page outlines all of the things that I would like to intergrate into this library. I have not yet decided on the best way to implement these features, so if you have any ideas, please feel free to contribute. To add onto this list either make a pull request or post in the #pyfl forum channel on the `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/2w5KSXjhGe>`_.
